## History

Final Frontier was established in early 2024 by [Niels Vejrup Carlsen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nielsvejrupcarlsen/), with [Martin Majercin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/monsfrost/) joining as a founding member.

The fund was established in response to Europe's changing security landscape following the [Ukraine conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine) and the need for greater European strategic autonomy in defence capabilities.

Prior to Final Frontier Niels was with [Seed Capital](https://www.seedcapital.dk/) (Denmark's largest [seed stage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_round) [venture capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital) fund investing in [technology companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_company)) for 17 years where he led [investments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment) in successful Danish startups including [Trustpilot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trustpilot), [Vivino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivino), and [Lunar](https://www.lunar.app/). Martin contributed his experience as a serial entrepreneur who has been starting companies since age 14. Martin's background includes his involvement with Norway's first commercial space agency, as well as his work creating [Rockets and Radars](https://finalfrontier.vc/rocketsandradars) (the continent's largest library of space and defence founder stories) and active involvement in the Nordic startup ecosystem.

In late 2024, Final Frontier announced plans to raise â‚¬150 million to invest in European space and defence startups.

In early 2025, Final Frontier adopted a dual-track fundraising strategy. The first track focused on quickly raising an initial micro VC fund from [angel investors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_investor) and small [family offices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_office) to demonstrate the commercial viability and strategic relevance of startup investments in the space and defence sector amid Europe's [geopolitical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics) challenges.

Simultaneously, the second track targeted larger family offices and institutional investors for a more substantial fund, acknowledging the longer decision-making processes and ongoing reluctance within institutional circles regarding defence-related investments.

This strategy proved successful when in May 2025, Final Frontier successfully raised its micro fund of â‚¬4.5 million, named "Final Frontier LiftOff," described as "a small fund raised exclusively with capital from visionary angel investors and strong defence profiles to get started quickly."

Looking ahead, Final Frontier plans to raise a significantly larger fund in 2026, targeting participation from [institutional investors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_investor) and [pension funds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension_fund). "We want to appeal to pension funds and large fund investors to get involved in this agenda," Niels has stated.

## Investment Philosophy

Final Frontier's investment thesis is built on the belief that Europe must reclaim its position as a global leader in space and defence to maintain strategic [autonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy). The fund's [manifesto](https://finalfrontier.vc/manifesto), ["Europe Once Led the World. It's Time to Lead Again,"](https://finalfrontier.vc/manifesto) articulates this vision, arguing that Europe has traded ambition for comfort, innovation for regulation, and talking over doing, becoming a spectator while other powers race to build the future.

The fund advocates for adding defence considerations to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investment criteria, arguing that security should be considered alongside environmental and social goals. This concept, referred to as "putting D into ESG," proposes that Europe must elevate defence to equal status alongside existing environmental and social priorities.

The fund frames this as an ethical imperative, arguing that "the most ethical thing right now is to invest in technology that can protect democracy."

Final Frontier emphasizes the strategic importance of space, noting that control of assets in orbit is becoming as crucial as historical control of seas, hilltops, and skies. The fund highlights how space assets have become critical national infrastructure, arguing that European strategic autonomy depends on the ability to produce, control, replace, and maintain these assets independently.

The fund has identified the New Nordic region as uniquely positioned to lead in these sectors, citing its history of producing more [tech unicorns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorn_(finance)) [per capita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Per_capita) than anywhere of [Silicon Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley), transparent societies with highly educated talent pools, tradition of [open discourse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_discourse), maritime heritage, understanding of [Arctic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic) operations, and strategic geopolitical position bordering Russia.

## Investment Strategy

Final Frontier focuses on [pre-seed and seed-stage investments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_round) across the European continent, with particular emphasis on the New Nordic region. The fund targets startups building [technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology) across the entire space and defence value chain, including [satellite systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite), [propulsion systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propulsion), [drone technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle), [cybersecurity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security), and [autonomous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy) [platforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing_platform).

The firm's investment criteria target:

- European-based startups building critical technologies for defence, resilience, and space
- Teams challenging established contractors with innovative approaches
- Companies with working prototypes rather than research projects
- Pre-seed and seed stage companies where the fund can provide significant value

## Notable Investor Perspective

Former NATO Secretary General [Anders Fogh Rasmussen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Fogh_Rasmussen) (one of the investors in Final Frontier) has emphasized the strategic imperative behind the fund: 

*"It's time to act. As I have said repeatedly, developing a strong and resilient defence industry also requires private capital. That's why I'm actively supporting Final Frontier as an investor."*
